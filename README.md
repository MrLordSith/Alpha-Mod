# Alpha-Mod (Beta 1.7.3)
------------------------
Here you can tell me issues and stuff about it.
I would install it using MultiMC:
-Open MultiMC
-Create a new instance with Beta 1.7.3 
-Go to instance settings, version
-Click on the right on "add jar mod"
-Add the zip
-If java doesn't work, go to configuration and go to auto detect, select "java" or any other you have.
Play !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
